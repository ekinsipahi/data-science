# Stock Correlation Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted a stock correlation analysis focusing on Apple (AAPL) and the NASDAQ index. Using linear regression modeling techniques, I aimed to determine the correlation between AAPL stock prices and the broader market represented by NASDAQ.

### Key Findings:

- **Correlation Assessment:** Through linear regression analysis, I discovered a strong correlation between AAPL stock prices and the NASDAQ index.
  
- **Market Risk:** The analysis revealed that AAPL exhibited 1.5 times the market risk compared to the NASDAQ index.

- **Goodness of Fit:** The linear regression model achieved a goodness of fit of 76%, indicating a strong level of explanatory power in the relationship between AAPL and NASDAQ prices.

This project provided valuable insights into the relationship between AAPL stock and the broader market, highlighting AAPL's significant market risk and its strong correlation with NASDAQ movements.<br>
Also depending on this analysis our godness of fit was higher compared to the return based analysis so for every dollar nasdaq rises we can compare how much it affects AAPL it is better to check the dollar wise rise, instead of return based.
